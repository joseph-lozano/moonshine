# Earmark—A Pure Elixir Markdown Processor

This README contains the docstrings and doctests from the code by means of [extractly](https://hex.pm/packages/extractly)
and the following code examples are therefore verified with `ExUnit` doctests.

## Dependency

    { :earmark, "> x.y.z" }


## Earmark

### Abstract Syntax Tree and Rendering

The AST generation has now been moved out to [`EarmarkParser`](https://github.com/robertdober/earmark_parser)
which is installed as a dependency.

This brings some changes to this documentation and also deprecates the usage of `Earmark.as_ast`

Earmark takes care of rendering the AST to HTML, exposing some AST Transformation Tools and providing a CLI as escript.

Therefore you will not find a detailed description of the supported Markdown here anymore as this is done in
[here](https://hexdocs.pm/earmark_parser/EarmarkParser.html) 



#### Earmark.as_ast

WARNING: This is just a proxy towards `EarmarkParser.as_ast` and is deprecated, it will be removed in version 1.5!

Replace your calls to `Earmark.as_ast` with `EarmarkParse.as_ast` as soon as possible.

**N.B.** If all you use is `Earmark.as_ast` consider _only_ using `EarmarkParser`.

Also please refer yourself to the documentation of [`EarmarkParser`](https://hexdocs.pm/earmark_parser/EarmarkParser.html)


The function is described below and the other two API functions `as_html` and `as_html!` are now based upon
the structure of the result of `as_ast`.

    {:ok, ast, []}                   = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)
    {:ok, ast, deprecation_messages} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)
    {:error, ast, error_messages}    = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown)

#### Earmark.as_html

    {:ok, html_doc, []}                   = Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    {:ok, html_doc, deprecation_messages} = Earmark.as_html(markdown)
    {:error, html_doc, error_messages}    = Earmark.as_html(markdown)

#### Earmark.as_html!

    html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown, options)

Formats the error_messages returned by `as_html` and adds the filename to each.
Then prints them to stderr and just returns the html_doc

#### Options

Options can be passed into as `as_html/2` or `as_html!/2` according to the documentation.
A keyword list with legal options (c.f. `Earmark.Options`) or an `Earmark.Options` struct are accepted.

    {status, html_doc, errors} = Earmark.as_html(markdown, options)
    html_doc = Earmark.as_html!(markdown, options)
    {status, ast, errors} = EarmarkParser.as_ast(markdown, options)

### Rendering

All options passed through to `EarmarkParser.as_ast` are defined therein, however some options concern only
the rendering of the returned AST

These are:

* `compact_output:` defaults to `false`

Normally `Earmark` aims to produce _Human Readable_ output.

This will give results like these:

    iex(0)> markdown = "# Hello\nWorld"
    ...(0)> Earmark.as_html!(markdown, compact_output: false)
    "<h1>\nHello</h1>\n<p>\nWorld</p>\n"


But sometimes whitespace is not desired:

    iex(1)> markdown = "# Hello\nWorld"
    ...(1)> Earmark.as_html!(markdown, compact_output: true)
    "<h1>Hello</h1><p>World</p>"

Be cautions though when using this options, lines will become loooooong.


#### `escape:` defaulting to `true`

If set HTML will be properly escaped

      iex(2)> markdown = "Hello<br />World"
      ...(2)> Earmark.as_html!(markdown)
      "<p>\nHello&lt;br /&gt;World</p>\n"

However disabling `escape:` gives you maximum control of the created document, which in some
cases (e.g. inside tables) might even be necessary

      iex(3)> markdown = "Hello<br />World"
      ...(3)> Earmark.as_html!(markdown, escape: false)
      "<p>\nHello<br />World</p>\n"

* `postprocessor:` defaults to nil

Before rendering the AST is transformed by a postprocessor.
For details see the description of `Earmark.Transform.map_ast·` below which will accept the same postprocessor as
a matter of fact specifying `postprocessor: fun` is conecptionnaly the same as

          markdown
          |> EarmarkParser.as_ast
          |> Earmark.Transform.map_ast(fun)
          |> Earmark.Transform.transform

with all the necessary bookkeeping for options and messages

* `renderer:` defaults to `Earmark.HtmlRenderer`

  The module used to render the final document.

#### `smartypants:` defaulting to `true`

If set the following replacements will be made during rendering of inline text

    "---" → "—"
    "--" → "–"
    "' → "’"
    ?" → "”"
    "..." → "…"

### Command line

    $ mix escript.build
    $ ./earmark file.md

Some options defined in the `Earmark.Options` struct can be specified as command line switches.

Use

    $ ./earmark --help

to find out more, but here is a short example

    $ ./earmark --smartypants false --code-class-prefix "a- b-" file.md

will call

    Earmark.as_html!( ..., %Earmark.Options{smartypants: false, code_class_prefix: "a- b-"})

## Timeouts

By default, that is if the `timeout` option is not set Earmark uses parallel mapping as implemented in `Earmark.pmap/2`,
which uses `Task.await` with its default timeout of 5000ms.

In rare cases that might not be enough.

By indicating a longer `timeout` option in milliseconds Earmark will use parallel mapping as implemented in `Earmark.pmap/3`,
which will pass `timeout` to `Task.await`.

In both cases one can override the mapper function with either the `mapper` option (used if and only if `timeout` is nil) or the
`mapper_with_timeout` function (used otherwise).

For the escript only the `timeout` command line argument can be used.

## Security

Please be aware that Markdown is not a secure format. It produces
HTML from Markdown and HTML. It is your job to sanitize and or
filter the output of `Earmark.as_html` if you cannot trust the input
and are to serve the produced HTML on the Web.



# Transformations

## Structure Conserving Transformers

For the convenience of processing the output of `EarmarkParser.as_ast` we expose two structure conserving
mappers.

### `map_ast`

takes a function that will be called for each node of the AST, where a leaf node is either a quadruple
like `{"code", [{"class", "inline"}], ["some code"], %{}}` or a text leaf like `"some code"`

The result of the function call must be

- for nodes → a quadruple of which the third element will be ignored -- that might change in future,
and will therefore classically be `nil`. The other elements replace the node

- for strings → strings

A third parameter `ignore_strings` which defaults to `false` can be used to avoid invocation of the mapper
function for text nodes

As an example let us transform an ast to have symbol keys

      iex(0)> input = [
      ...(0)> {"h1", [], ["Hello"], %{title: true}},
      ...(0)> {"ul", [], [{"li", [], ["alpha"], %{}}, {"li", [], ["beta"], %{}}], %{}}] 
      ...(0)> map_ast(input, fn {t, a, _, m} -> {String.to_atom(t), a, nil, m} end, true)
      [ {:h1, [], ["Hello"], %{title: true}},
        {:ul, [], [{:li, [], ["alpha"], %{}}, {:li, [], ["beta"], %{}}], %{}} ]

**N.B.** If this returning convention is not respected `map_ast` might not complain, but the resulting
transformation might not be suitable for `Earmark.Transform.transform` anymore. From this follows that
any function passed in as value of the `postprocessor:` option must obey to these conventions.

### `map_ast_with`

this is like `map_ast` but like a reducer an accumulator can also be passed through.

For that reason the function is called with two arguments, the first element being the same value
as in `map_ast` and the second the accumulator. The return values need to be equally augmented 
tuples.

A simple example, annotating traversal order in the meta map's `:count` key, as we are not
interested in text nodes we use the fourth parameter `ignore_strings` which defaults to `false`

       iex(0)>  input = [
       ...(0)>  {"ul", [], [{"li", [], ["one"], %{}}, {"li", [], ["two"], %{}}], %{}},
       ...(0)>  {"p", [], ["hello"], %{}}]
       ...(0)>  counter = fn {t, a, _, m}, c -> {{t, a, nil, Map.put(m, :count, c)}, c+1} end
       ...(0)>  map_ast_with(input, 0, counter, true) 
       {[ {"ul", [], [{"li", [], ["one"], %{count: 1}}, {"li", [], ["two"], %{count: 2}}], %{count: 0}},
         {"p", [], ["hello"], %{count: 3}}], 4}

## Structure Modifying Transformers

For structure modifications a tree traversal is needed and no clear pattern of how to assist this task with
tools has emerged yet.



## Contributing

Pull Requests are happily accepted.

Please be aware of one _caveat_ when correcting/improving `README.md`.

The `README.md` is generated by `Extractly` as mentioned above and therefore contributers shall not modify it directly, but
`README.md.eex` and the imported docs instead.

Thank you all who have already helped with Earmark, your names are duely noted in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
